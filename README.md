# Yet Another Todo App (YATA)
## Now with 100% more Laravel and Vue!

### Requirements:
  - docker-compose
  - php
  - composer
  - yarn

### Steps to set up:

1. Clone repository: `git clone git@github.com:wahidrahim/yata-laravel-vue.git`
2. Open two separate terminal windows
3. In the first terminal `cd` into `yata-laravel-vue` and run `make laravel`
4. In the second terminal `cd` into `yata-laravel-vue` and run `make vue`

The two processes (api and vue client) should be started.

You should now be able to visit: `http://localhost:8080` to see the app in action.
